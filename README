High Level Project Implementation Steps
#################################

* Projects folder structure created
* Major libraries are integrated (navigation, state management etc...)
* App launcher icon generated for Android & IOS
* Orientation lock setting is completed both for Android & IOS
* Splash screen created and integrated for Android & IOS
* Camera barcode reader integration completed
* Infura.io account created and picked Goerli test network
* Created an account via https://www.alchemy.com/ facuet to be able to load test ETH token via https://goerlifaucet.com/
* Tried to integrate web3js with react native 0.71 however faced too many unresolvable issues where other people having the similar.
    Most errors were related with randomNumbergenerators or node-libs-browser-react-native.
    Please see for exm. https://gist.github.com/dougbacelar/29e60920d8fa1982535247563eb63766
    Most people who are succeeded to integrate web3js was at React Native version 0.59
* I looked for an alternate solution and found ethers.js. And then integrated https://github.com/heroims/react-native-web3-wallet library where its based on ethers.js
* Integrated and implemeneted UI designs based on given Figma design.
* Discovered first time how to manage a blockchain library and use its methods.
* Integrated Lottie for animations.
* Applied form validations, alerts and toast for user messages.
* Some unit tests added.


Folder Structure
#################################
src/assets => Static files and lottie animations
src/components => Common components that are re-used in UI pages
src/consts => Colors, Blockchain related variables, Types, Links, Validators
src/hooks => Custom hooks
src/redux => State management
src/ui => User Faced designs and mobile app pages.


Project Installation Steps
#################################
git clone https://github.com/buraky84/MobileWalletX
cd MobileWalletX
yarn install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
cp -R node_modules/react-native-web3-wallet/patches .
npx patch-package

Note: Everytime running yarn add or yarn install we need to run 'npx patch-package' afterwards.

THEN...
npx react-native run-ios OR npx react-native run-android


How to test it
#################################
* There is currently 3 ways to access to a wallet which are all functional.
    1) Create a new Wallet
    2) Import an existing Wallet (Already created 2 test wallet)
     a) Import by mnemonic 12 words phrase (wallet info1.txt & wallet info2.txt)
     b) Import by QR (wallet QR1.png & wallet QR2.png)

* All of above methods redirects user from Onboarding to Wallet page.
* Wallet page has below functionalities up and running.
    1) Displays user address / balance
    2) Displays last 10 transactions
    3) Allows user to send ETH over Goerli Network.


Possible Improvements
#################################
* Integrate Theme support so customers may use dark / bright mode.
* Integrate locize / localize for multilanguage support.
* Add more functional tests & integrate UI testing.
* Work on performance optimization.
* Disable Android back button.
* Add more blockchain functionalities such as NFTs / etc.
* Integrate appcenter for CodePush (for quick fixes)
* Integrate sentry for production logs (better analyze customer spesific issues)
* Integrate Push Notifications for better user interaction.
(For exm. when the app is killed would be good to inform user that he/she has recieved x amount of ETH. or Withdrawal Completed etc..)
* Would create some bash scripts to generate automated Android apk/aab or IOS ipa with Flavor configuration (for development / staging / production environments)

My Thoughts
#################################
As a crypto related person, i am happy to first time get integrated to blockchain and web3 technology.
Lost quite amount of time while searching web3 things and stuck with dependencies during web3 integration.
In a limited time, it was great experience for me to get friendly to Web3 terminology and to complete requested functionalities.
